Azra:Essays again this week
Azra:Messages to this chat and calls are now secured with end-to-end encryption.
Azra:I need some space from you. I don’t think we should talk. I find you have a really negative energy and I’m trying really hard not to let that into my life. If you still can please rescind the gift as I feel it will have the same negative impact on me. I’m sorry but that’s truly how I feel. I kind of regret letting you into my life/ space but I suppose you only find out after it’s over or out of your life.
Azra: Ok
