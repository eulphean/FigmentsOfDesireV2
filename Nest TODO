What is a Desire? 
Desire is the energy that mind generates when it wishes something. It's a chaahat, it's an expression of longing. It's an expression of need. When a desire originates, we tend to behave certain ways. We tend to perform certain actions. Using this model, this system works. 

What does it lead to?
- When we have desires, things we want. That's our mind telling us what we want, it leads to certain behaviors. 

Visuals
- Create another agent shape for the other one. Now, I'm actually commenting on Gender somehow, am I not? 
- These agents interact and start developing pairs. 
- They break and their desires keep evolving. They live in an open society without and get to be with whatever. 
- Two different shapes will actually give it more character.  

Frame Capture
- For the screenshots for press release (this) => Add high quality frame capture for the screenshot. 

Obstacles
- Rather than having a boundary, an algorithm to move the creatures from one part of the screen to the other
- Design obstacles the agents can hit

Entanglement
- Bonds, when would bonding happen now? Come with an algorithm to define when would these creatures express
their desires and how would these desires work? 

Background
- Update background. Make it more GOD like. 
Layers - Layers - Layers
Layers - Layers - Layers


LAN (local agent nest)
To Do:
Get rid of the PARTNER logic. 

Do Desire States still matter now? Maybe the states work differently now?
Both the agents look way too similar right now, let's make sure there is enough variety in both of them so that whenever I create an agent, it looks different than the last one. 

Agents are having a conversation with each other. Do they have a conversation with each other by sending each other messages.. Whenever a message is sent, there are certain conversations happening between them. 

NEST => They are making a nest, a structural, system, a rhizomatic system of connections. That's their tendency. It's very much inspired from nature. How birds would come together. It creates this relationship between this nest and the humans like how we are in coexistence with animals. But what about this relationship? 

So, using this nest as the material for inspiration, I need to go and create a discourse around this. A web of connections. Is it the internet? The agents have a tendency to get together and start weaving a nest. A structure that maintains harmony, that keeps them going, or else they exhibit a wild behavior of uncertainty or uneasiness. How does the relation of this nest work in connection with humans who can be interrupting this nest? What kind of a relation am I creating here? 

Installation Notes
Install the projector with the mirror and try to get it as rectangular as possible with keystoning. 
Put some big object in the center of the projeted area. 
Install the Kinect and put the app in Debug mode.
Try to align the center of the Kinect with the center of the object. 
That's when both Kinect and Projector will be aligned to scan properly. 
Now, use the KinectParams in the app to set the max/min distance for detect object properly. 
Align the Kinect and the projector so it's easier to set it up while installing. 

THINGS BROKEN
- Partner logic
- AssignIndices 
- Handling Any Sort of Behavior except Stretch/Flick not working
- No autonomy of agents currently
- Background doesn't move with the agents (this makes us frop way too many frames. It's difficul

Things to do today (Wednesday, August 21, 2019)
1: Add a flag in the GUI to change the probablity of creating agents
2: Mouse input add attraction/repulsion for the agents
3: Get the current position using the Kinect (from push/pop matrix to attract/repulse agents)
4: Really nasty bug in creating the mesh vertices for the interagent joints (look at that)
5: Background
- Depth level 
- Shader on interaction 
- I'll go for a run tonight. 

// After this I will think about prints (what works would I like to print and have a technological counterpart along with it. Biology. Think about it/ Research a little about / Genetic Evolution / Machine Learning maybe - That research paper by that artist - Object detector - Computer Vision on images)
