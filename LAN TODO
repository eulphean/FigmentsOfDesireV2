What is a Desire? 
Desire is the energy that mind generates when it wishes something. It's a chaahat, it's an expression of longing. It's an expression of need. When a desire originates, we tend to behave certain ways. We tend to perform certain actions. Using this model, this system works. 

What does it lead to?
- When we have desires, things we want. That's our mind telling us what we want, it leads to certain behaviors. 

Visuals
- Create another agent shape for the other one. Now, I'm actually commenting on Gender somehow, am I not? 
- These agents interact and start developing pairs. 
- They break and their desires keep evolving. They live in an open society without and get to be with whatever. 
- Two different shapes will actually give it more character.  

Frame Capture
- For the screenshots for press release (this) => Add high quality frame capture for the screenshot. 

Obstacles
- Rather than having a boundary, an algorithm to move the creatures from one part of the screen to the other
- Design obstacles the agents can hit

Entanglement
- Bonds, when would bonding happen now? Come with an algorithm to define when would these creatures express
their desires and how would these desires work? 

Background
- Update background. Make it more GOD like. 
Layers - Layers - Layers
Layers - Layers - Layers


Writeups
- Think about the overall theme of this work. Is this about coexistence?
- What is this work about really?

Maybe how they both look like
Alpha Beta (Amay, Azra)


LAN (local agent nest)
To Do:
Get rid of the PARTNER logic. 
For background, pick the right vertex with wihich I want to interact with the background. 
Clean up the GUI
On Resizing of the window, clear all agents and recreate the world.
Refactor the texture design for the agent (should they both look the same)
Do Desire States still matter now? Maybe the states work differently now?
Both the agents look way too similar right now, let's make sure there is enough variety in both of them so that whenever I create an agent, it looks different than the last one. 

Agents are having a conversation with each other. Do they have a conversation with each other by sending each other messages.. Whenever a message is sent, there are certain conversations happening between them. 

NEST => They are making a nest, a structural, system, a rhizomatic system of connections. That's their tendency. It's very much inspired from nature. How birds would come together. It creates this relationship between this nest and the humans like how we are in coexistence with animals. But what about this relationship? 

So, using this nest as the material for inspiration, I need to go and create a discourse around this. A web of connections. Is it the internet? The agents have a tendency to get together and start weaving a nest. A structure that maintains harmony, that keeps them going, or else they exhibit a wild behavior of uncertainty or uneasiness. How does the relation of this nest work in connection with humans who can be interrupting this nest? What kind of a relation am I creating here? 

That's why the sky is working out well I think, 

MESSAGES 
These are messages sent by agents across this web for communicating with each other. 

Resize and GUI cleanup (right now, right now)
Very simple interaction.
