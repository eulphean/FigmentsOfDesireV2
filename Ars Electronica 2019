Ars Electronica 2019 Deadlines

Behaviors
- How to make the interactive behaviors for all the agents, rather than just a few of them.
What is the algorithm I should go with? 
- Desires versus Behaviors. What direction is this work heading in? How do desires map on top of the behaviors? 
- When we have desires, things we want. That's our mind telling us what we want, it leads to certain behaviors. 
- When we come in contact with others, what sort of interactions happen? 
- How to activate behaviors when there are multiple agents involved? 
- Turn off swapping of textures for now. It's not really doing anything. 
- It could be really interesting if the two agents are two different shapes.

Visuals
- Create another agent shape for the other one. Now, I'm actually commenting on Gender somehow, am I not? 
- These agents interact and start developing pairs. 
- They break and their desires keep evolving. They live in an open society without and get to be with whatever. 
- Two different shapes will actually give it more character.  

Frame Capture
- For the screenshots for press release (this) => Add high quality frame capture for the screenshot. 

Obstacles
- Rather than having a boundary, an algorithm to move the creatures from one part of the screen to the other
- Design obstacles the agents can hit

Entanglement
- Bonds, when would bonding happen now? Come with an algorithm to define when would these creatures express
their desires and how would these desires work? 

Background
- Update background. Make it more GOD like. 
Layers - Layers - Layers
Layers - Layers - Layers


Writeups
- Think about the overall theme of this work. Is this about coexistence?
- What is this work about really?
