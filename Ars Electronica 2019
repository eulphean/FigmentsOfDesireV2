What is a Desire? 
Desire is the energy that mind generates when it wishes something. It's a chaahat, it's an expression of longing. It's an expression of need. When a desire originates, we tend to behave certain ways. We tend to perform certain actions. Using this model, this system works. 

What does it lead to?
- When we have desires, things we want. That's our mind telling us what we want, it leads to certain behaviors. 

Visuals
- Create another agent shape for the other one. Now, I'm actually commenting on Gender somehow, am I not? 
- These agents interact and start developing pairs. 
- They break and their desires keep evolving. They live in an open society without and get to be with whatever. 
- Two different shapes will actually give it more character.  

Frame Capture
- For the screenshots for press release (this) => Add high quality frame capture for the screenshot. 

Obstacles
- Rather than having a boundary, an algorithm to move the creatures from one part of the screen to the other
- Design obstacles the agents can hit

Entanglement
- Bonds, when would bonding happen now? Come with an algorithm to define when would these creatures express
their desires and how would these desires work? 

Background
- Update background. Make it more GOD like. 
Layers - Layers - Layers
Layers - Layers - Layers
