Reaching Delhi on 20th evening (Sunday),
Hey! 20th I reach at 8pm in the evening. My flight is at midnight on 22nd. 
Oh no!
Did you have class today?
Haha.
Don’t worry. It might be very tight to connect in person before I leave. Focus on your classes and get your work done. We’ll just FaceTime 🙂
Call.
I’m glad you at least have Ayesha’s company to keep you entertained
🙁🙁🙁
Haha, meant to happen then. Now, have a nice and relaxing weekend.
Just sat in the taxi. On the way to Mahabaleshwar. Very relaxed. Ready to see some nature.
Lots of missing is happening.
I never asked you how you felt about me and don’t even want to ask that on messaging. But we should kindle what we have in the coming time 🌺
Views are awesome. Did you get some sleep?
👏 👏 all set for the weekend!
I’m getting hit by post party lows right now 🙁🙁😢
When do you land in Delhi on Monday?
I hope your flight doesn’t get delayed
Yeah, I wanna see you. I feel like shit. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just withdrawal symptoms.
Time will make it better, hopefully. Right now, too many things are looming on my mind.
You have an awesome weekend. Let me know your flight #. 🤞, we get a chance to briefly meet in person on Monday.
You are a bag full of cuteness 🌺 
Nature makes me 🙂😀🍭😃🌈
Haan, mostly. The cab would take us to a spot and then we would start exploring. 
Is that some new movie?
I hear you on this. I need to figure out what’s going to work out. My flight is on 23rd morning at 2am. So I need to leave from home by 11pm. For that I need to leave city by 10pm max. 
We can work this out on Monday night also. So, no sweat. Enjoy your last day at home.
Haha, nice. I am taking some too with me to Delhi. Hopefully, it’ll be okay.
Hmm. Where does it drop you? 
💙 thanks for this info 💙 let me see what could work best so we can spend maximum time with each other
Well deserved leisure after  the most fun and hardworking month. So happy to be home on my bed, underneath a trippy ceiling, reading a book, listening to rad tunes and just relaxing. 
😢😢 school’s gonna start for me too. Just two days of fun. School starts for me on Thursday.
Call me tonight if you are free.
🌈🌺🍭🙏
Haha, you’re a night owl. I know
I’m tracking your flight.
I mean..
I’m tired of these sip sip messages on WhatsApp. Get your work done and hit me up 🙂 if not, it’s all cool. We’ll connect another time.
Happy landings❤️
Yeah, I can imagine.
Weather is clear in Delhi. You’ll land in time.
I’m outside / don’t miss me 🙂
🙌🏽🌺🌈 so good to hear that. 
Sorry I’m getting a massage right now 😶😶Voice was cracking but I heard you. I’m going to confirm with my mom what’s the plan and tell you.
Okay, my mom ditched on the movies. I’m down to chill tonight. I asked Ayesha as well.
I proposed Ek bar in Def col in South Delhi. If she’s not down, we both can meet somewhere in West Delhi.
Lajpat Nagar metro station is the closest to our spot.
If Ayesha can’t make it, I’ll meet you closer to Jehangirpuri and we can figure out where to go. She said she’ll confirm at 4.
Call me when you leaving
My eta to get there is 6:10pm. You might get there before me.
Delhi number
WhatsApp on US Bennet
Number^
Ayesha will meet us there. RD couldn’t make it
Yes
How many stop away from there?
Cool. I’m 25 mins away
🤟
10 mins 🙌🏽
You’ll reach before me.
Just come down. I’ll pick you.
It’s called EK bar
Yeah, about 200m from there
Home. We wrapped up in time. It’s raining cats and dogs now
Up. Call when you free.
Im going to miss you a lot.
I hate goodbyes and I have said too many goodbyes to you. If I come see you again, I won’t be able to leave.
🍓 🍓 from Mahabaleshwar
Thank you so much for this. In the grand scheme of things, these 10 days feel very life changing to me. I’m taking back a very different vibe, one that I haven’t felt in a long time or maybe never even felt before. It’s all because of you, your generosity, and your presence in my life. 
Nothing interesting on it.
You should be able to see now. It has fragmented memories in no specific order.
I’m packed, showered and sitting for dinner soon. And then off for the airport. 
2am
Lol. Yeah it’s awesome 😎
I hope you’re getting work done 🤟👌 hope to catch up with you before I board 🙂
Yeah, in a bit
Insanely long frikking lines for security check 😞😞
Azra call me
Cell par
Made it. Safe and sound
🙃
Yeah, slightly jet lagged. Slept at 4pm, woke up around 3am.
No, it’s personal.
Just looked through your insta. There is a lot. I need to keep going back. My favourite one was modern day ❤️-story. 
You know how I feel about you. The journals are just an attempt to verbalise those feelings and come to terms with it. 
Just wanted to correct myself. I hate ‘making’ interactive work cuz I can’t convince myself about the interaction. 
You back in your room?
Please don’t get sick. Drink honey and hot water 😶
Off for class. Take care of yourself and sleep well. 
🌺🌈
Yea.
Warm virtual hugs for you. Get well soon ☀️☀️☀️
😪😪
❤️🌺 take care ❤️🌺
Nice 👍🏻
Miss you. 
Yeah, I miss all the time we spent with each other. And i miss you. 
Sorry 😐 but it’s how it is 😐
🤗 yeah. When you done with your essay, call me if you feel like 💕❤️🌺
How’s the cold? Feeling better today?
Good.
It’s going alright. Opening was great last night. Went out briefly for drinks. It’s such bitter cold here, omg. I’m cold even inside the apartment when the heat is pushed up high. 
Classes might get cancelled^
I’m glad you’re feeling better. Now you can be more productive. Maybe it’s the after effect of us Video chatting 😬
👏👏👏
🙂👌
I miss you so much 😢
I miss your gracious smile. 
Right back at you 🌸 🌹
🤟
Have fun at the Indian art fair. Events look great. Wish I was there 🙂
🌻
Have a great day! 🎸🌼 
ps: this is my ‘I’m thinking about you’ flower
Alright
Lol you didn’t have to delete that message
I hear you. I won’t send it 🙂
Tc have a good week ahead. Good luck with L your deliverables.
Also, don’t keep too much suspense in the air. If you have something to say, please say it sooner than later. 
Theek hai tu?
Kabhi call karley. Not sure what you’re trying to do, honestly. Whatever it is, I hope we’ll talk soon
Alright - i don’t feel good about this. Don’t think it’s so hard to take out a little time and talk.
