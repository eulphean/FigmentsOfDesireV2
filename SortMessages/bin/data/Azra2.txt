[2/11/19, 4:16:58 AM] â€ªAzra Bhagat: I need some space from you. I donâ€™t think we should talk. I find you have a really negative energy and Iâ€™m trying really hard not to let that into my life. If you still can please rescind the gift as I feel it will have the same negative impact on me. Iâ€™m sorry but thatâ€™s truly how I feel. I kind of regret letting you into my life/ space but I suppose you only find out after itâ€™s over or out of your life.
[2/11/19, 5:59:01 AM] Amay: Azbee! Get a grip on yourself. Please donâ€™t let this ruin a little bit of what we have. 

We are friends. Nothing elseâ€™s Letâ€™s just maintain that. Donâ€™t think too much. Just relax.
[2/11/19, 5:59:26 AM] â€ªAzra Bhagat: Ok
[2/11/19, 6:04:31 AM] Amay: Iâ€™m not thinking anything else, I promise. I understood everything you told me the other day. I just wanna be friends. And nothing else. Please look at me like your friend you can reach out to anytime. All the other feelings are kept aside. I promise you and I wonâ€™t say anything or do anything thatâ€™ll make you feel pressured to do something on those lines. 

Iâ€™m sorry you feel I have negative energy. I feel sad about it but Iâ€™m going to keep very limited contact with you so I hope you understand my importance in your life (if you do), 

I really wish you feel better. Itâ€™s important for me. And for that if I have to even stop talking to you, I will.
[2/11/19, 6:08:14 AM] Amay: Iâ€™m not rescinding anything. What I did, what I made, I put my heart and my love in it. You can destroy it and get rid of it if you want (donâ€™t tell me) but please accept it. It resolves things for me. It resolves my feelings. 

Take it as a gesture of good faith. Iâ€™m over my feelings of deep attachment that I felt for you. 

I hope we can maintain a healthy friendship in the coming time.
[2/11/19, 6:09:51 AM] Amay: Take care ðŸŒº warm hugs and lots of love dear. Have a good week ðŸ™‚
[2/11/19, 6:13:32 AM] Amay: My one concern there is. If you are beginning to feel  this confused emotional platonic state because of me, these paranoia feelings because of â€˜meâ€™, then I must and I must stop talking to you. Absolutely no contact. I want you to feel better yar. I want you to feel positive, good and healthy. And if Iâ€™m being the reason you are going through all this again, I must leave. 

I have that much sense.
[2/11/19, 6:15:28 AM] Amay: Please think clearly if we can be friends with minimum contact or does that not work as well. 

Maybe just observe things for some time and decide. 

If they donâ€™t, I will be more than happy to not even say a word to you. But if it doesnâ€™t, I hope we can be still be friends ðŸ™‚
[2/11/19, 6:40:16 AM] Amay: Treat me like someone you can trust, 
Treat me like you someone you can pick up the phone and just call, 
Treat me like someone you can look upto for support, 
Treat me like someone who can hold your hand when you are low and tired of this life,
Treat me like someone who can cheer you up, make you smile, and feel good,
Treat me like your friend, not your lover, and respond with feelings that are pure, unbiased, unfettered by love but by care, compassion, empathy, support, and friendship. 

I donâ€™t know what else to say. So Iâ€™ll stop saying and get back to my Dhyaan ðŸ™‚

Have a good evening. 

P.s. donâ€™t feel compelled to reply to any of this. Just clear your mind and understand it. I will seek acknowledgement in your silence.
