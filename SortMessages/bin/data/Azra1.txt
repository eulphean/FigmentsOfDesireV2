[1/18/19, 11:17:22 PM] Amay: Yeah, I wanna see you. I feel like shit. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just withdrawal symptoms.
[1/18/19, 11:55:48 PM] Amay: Time will make it better, hopefully. Right now, too many things are looming on my mind.

How much time does it take you to get into the city from the shuttle? Say you leave at 5:15, when do you get into the city?

[1/20/19, 11:39:38 PM] Azra Bhagat: Dude, this was the cutest thing🤭☺ I’m so glad I got to see you. Was feeling really low about coming back to Delhi today and you kind of made it all better. Early morning bandaid🤗💖
[1/20/19, 11:58:24 PM] Amay: 🙌🏽🌺🌈 so good to hear that. 

There are no emoticons to express how I feel right now. So I’ll use words only. 

I feel relieved. I feel happy. And I’m so glad I saw you. There is so much more I want to talk to you about. Tell me how your day goes and we’ll see what happens tomorrow. 

Welcome back to the city. Reach safely. Lots of hugs, lots of love 🤗

[1/22/19, 6:04:59 AM] Amay: Thank you so much for this. In the grand scheme of things, these 10 days feel very life changing to me. I’m taking back a very different vibe, one that I haven’t felt in a long time or maybe never even felt before. It’s all because of you, your generosity, and your presence in my life. 

Things are not the same anymore. Happiness comes and goes. But relationships stay. I hope we can build a good one 👌🌈🤟

Feels like I’m not going to Chicago alone. It feels like something.

[1/24/19, 3:56:23 AM] Amay: Just looked through your insta. There is a lot. I need to keep going back. My favourite one was modern day ❤️-story. 

Also, I love your poetry. I shortlisted some and I’ll be putting them up in my studio if you don’t mind. So insightful, deep, and mesmerising.
[1/24/19, 3:59:10 AM] Amay: You know how I feel about you. The journals are just an attempt to verbalise those feelings and come to terms with it. 

If you can feel what I feel, you are already on top of what I am thinking 🙂
[1/24/19, 4:53:44 AM] Amay: Just wanted to correct myself. I hate ‘making’ interactive work cuz I can’t convince myself about the interaction. 

I don’t hate interactive work. I love interactive work. It’s fun and playful and can be very impactful. 

I just don’t know how to talk about it. 

Tty soon.

No matter how much you say about being practical, I can’t stop thinking about you. 

I don’t want to be practical. I want to live in the moment. And in this moment, I’m in love with you. And I want to cherish it. 

So you can be practical and do all what you wanna do. I’m going to be how I am and won’t stop nurturing what we have.

And I really do think we feel the same way about each other. I just want you to be happy and not compromise on your life in Chicago because of me. Because I really want the best for you and I care about your happiness.
