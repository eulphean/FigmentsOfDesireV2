
Amay:Reaching Delhi on 20th evening (Sunday),and 22nd evening I leave. Gives us 21st to hang. Let me know if you’d be down to meet. If not, totally cool👌
Amay:Hey! 20th I reach at 8pm in the evening. My flight is at midnight on 22nd. Hope you at the airport now.
Amay:Oh no!
Amay:Did you have class today?
Amay:Haha.
Amay:Don’t worry. It might be very tight to connect in person before I leave. Focus on your classes and get your work done. We’ll just FaceTime 🙂
Amay:Call.
Amay:I’m glad you at least have Ayesha’s company to keep you entertained
Amay:🙁🙁🙁
Amay:Haha, meant to happen then. Now, have a nice and relaxing weekend.
Amay:Just sat in the taxi. On the way to Mahabaleshwar. Very relaxed. Ready to see some nature.
Amay:Lots of missing is happening.
Amay:I never asked you how you felt about me and don’t even want to ask that on messaging. But we should kindle what we have in the coming time 🌺
Amay:Views are awesome. Did you get some sleep?
Amay:👏 👏 all set for the weekend!
Amay:I’m getting hit by post party lows right now 🙁🙁😢
Amay:When do you land in Delhi on Monday?
Amay:I hope your flight doesn’t get delayed
Amay:Yeah, I wanna see you. I feel like shit. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just withdrawal symptoms.
Amay:Time will make it better, hopefully. Right now, too many things are looming on my mind.
Amay:You have an awesome weekend. Let me know your flight #. 🤞, we get a chance to briefly meet in person on Monday.
Amay:You are a bag full of cuteness 🌺 Thanks to Ayesha for sending me these.
Amay:Nature makes me 🙂😀🍭😃🌈
Amay:Haan, mostly. The cab would take us to a spot and then we would start exploring. It’s done now. On the way to Panchgani and then to Pune. And then flying to Delhi in the evening.
Amay:Is that some new movie?
Amay:I hear you on this. I need to figure out what’s going to work out. My flight is on 23rd morning at 2am. So I need to leave from home by 11pm. For that I need to leave city by 10pm max. How much time does it take you to get into the city from the shuttle? Say you leave at 5:15, when do you get into the city?
Amay:We can work this out on Monday night also. So, no sweat. Enjoy your last day at home.
Amay:Haha, nice. I am taking some too with me to Delhi. Hopefully, it’ll be okay.
Amay:Hmm. Where does it drop you? What about at night? Is it safe to take it back?
Amay:💙 thanks for this info 💙 let me see what could work best so we can spend maximum time with each other
Amay:Well deserved leisure after  the most fun and hardworking month. So happy to be home on my bed, underneath a trippy ceiling, reading a book, listening to rad tunes and just relaxing. Very lucky and happy to have got to know you 🙂🌈 You’re on my mind, Azra Bhagat.
Amay:😢😢 school’s gonna start for me too. Just two days of fun. School starts for me on Thursday.
Amay:Call me tonight if you are free.
Amay:🌈🌺🍭🙏
Amay:Haha, you’re a night owl. I know
Amay:I’m tracking your flight.
Amay:I mean..
Amay:I’m tired of these sip sip messages on WhatsApp. Get your work done and hit me up 🙂 if not, it’s all cool. We’ll connect another time.
Amay:Happy landings❤️
Amay:Yeah, I can imagine.
Amay:Weather is clear in Delhi. You’ll land in time.
Amay:I’m outside / don’t miss me 🙂
Amay:🙌🏽🌺🌈 so good to hear that. There are no emoticons to express how I feel right now. So I’ll use words only. I feel relieved. I feel happy. And I’m so glad I saw you. There is so much more I want to talk to you about. Tell me how your day goes and we’ll see what happens tomorrow. Welcome back to the city. Reach safely. Lots of hugs, lots of love 🤗

Amay:Sorry I’m getting a massage right now 😶😶Voice was cracking but I heard you. I’m going to confirm with my mom what’s the plan and tell you.
Amay:Okay, my mom ditched on the movies. I’m down to chill tonight. I asked Ayesha as well.
Amay:I proposed Ek bar in Def col in South Delhi. If she’s not down, we both can meet somewhere in West Delhi.
Amay:Lajpat Nagar metro station is the closest to our spot.
Amay:If Ayesha can’t make it, I’ll meet you closer to Jehangirpuri and we can figure out where to go. She said she’ll confirm at 4.
Amay:Call me when you leaving
Amay:My eta to get there is 6:10pm. You might get there before me.
Amay:Delhi number
Amay:WhatsApp on US Bennet
Amay:Number^
Amay:Ayesha will meet us there. RD couldn’t make it
Amay:Yes
Amay:How many stop away from there?
Amay:Cool. I’m 25 mins away
Amay:🤟
Amay:10 mins 🙌🏽
Amay:You’ll reach before me.
Amay:Just come down. I’ll pick you.
Amay:It’s called EK bar
Amay:Yeah, about 200m from there
Amay:Home. We wrapped up in time. It’s raining cats and dogs now
Amay:Up. Call when you free.
Amay:Im going to miss you a lot.
Amay:I hate goodbyes and I have said too many goodbyes to you. If I come see you again, I won’t be able to leave.
Amay:🍓 🍓 from Mahabaleshwar
Amay:Thank you so much for this. In the grand scheme of things, these 10 days feel very life changing to me. I’m taking back a very different vibe, one that I haven’t felt in a long time or maybe never even felt before. It’s all because of you, your generosity, and your presence in my life. Things are not the same anymore. Happiness comes and goes. But relationships stay. I hope we can build a good one 👌🌈🤟
Amay:Nothing interesting on it.
Amay:You should be able to see now. It has fragmented memories in no specific order.
Amay:I’m packed, showered and sitting for dinner soon. And then off for the airport. Feels like I’m not going to Chicago alone. It feels like something.
Amay:2am
Amay:Lol. Yeah it’s awesome 😎
Amay:I hope you’re getting work done 🤟👌 hope to catch up with you before I board 🙂
Amay:Yeah, in a bit
Amay:Insanely long frikking lines for security check 😞😞
Amay:Azra call me
Amay:Cell par
Amay:Made it. Safe and sound
Amay:🙃
Amay:Yeah, slightly jet lagged. Slept at 4pm, woke up around 3am.
Amay:No, it’s personal.
Amay:Just looked through your insta. There is a lot. I need to keep going back. My favourite one was modern day ❤️-story. Also, I love your poetry. I shortlisted some and I’ll be putting them up in my studio if you don’t mind. So insightful, deep, and mesmerising.
Amay:You know how I feel about you. The journals are just an attempt to verbalise those feelings and come to terms with it. If you can feel what I feel, you are already on top of what I am thinking 🙂
Amay:Just wanted to correct myself. I hate ‘making’ interactive work cuz I can’t convince myself about the interaction. I don’t hate interactive work. I love interactive work. It’s fun and playful and can be very impactful. I just don’t know how to talk about it. Tty soon.
Amay:You back in your room?
Amay:Please don’t get sick. Drink honey and hot water 😶
Amay:Off for class. Take care of yourself and sleep well. Lots of hugs 🤗
Amay:🌺🌈
Amay:Yea.
Amay:Warm virtual hugs for you. Get well soon ☀️☀️☀️
Amay:😪😪
Amay:❤️🌺 take care ❤️🌺
Amay:Nice 👍🏻
Amay:Miss you. Call when you taking a break and feeling better 🤗🤗
Amay:Yeah, I miss all the time we spent with each other. And i miss you. No matter how much you say about being practical, I can’t stop thinking about you. I don’t want to be practical. I want to live in the moment. And in this moment, I’m in love with you. And I want to cherish it. So you can be practical and do all what you wanna do. I’m going to be how I am and won’t stop nurturing what we have.
Amay:Sorry 😐 but it’s how it is 😐
Amay:🤗 yeah. When you done with your essay, call me if you feel like 💕❤️🌺
Amay:How’s the cold? Feeling better today?
Amay:Good.
Amay:It’s going alright. Opening was great last night. Went out briefly for drinks. It’s such bitter cold here, omg. I’m cold even inside the apartment when the heat is pushed up high. Next week there is a weather advisory here so I feel classes might get plan is to write proposals, update my portfolio website and apply for Residencies and some jobs. Probably head to my studio later today.
Amay:Classes might get cancelled^
Amay:I’m glad you’re feeling better. Now you can be more productive. Maybe it’s the after effect of us Video chatting 😬We should do that more often 🙂❤️
Amay:👏👏👏
Amay:🙂👌
Amay:I miss you so much 😢
Amay:I miss your gracious smile. I miss all that time. I miss your presence by my side.I miss your cuteness all the time.Not sure whats happening to me. Whatever it is, it feels I’m in love all this while..🙂 bye 👋
Amay:Right back at you 🌸 🌹
Amay:🤟
Amay:Have fun at the Indian art fair. Events look great. Wish I was there 🙂
Amay:🌻
Amay:Have a great day! 🎸🌼 Hope to hear from you soon, Azra.
Amay:ps: this is my ‘I’m thinking about you’ flower
Amay:Alright
Amay:Lol you didn’t have to delete that message
Amay:I hear you. I won’t send it 🙂
Amay:Tc have a good week ahead. Good luck with L your deliverables.
Amay:Also, don’t keep too much suspense in the air. If you have something to say, please say it sooner than later. I know you’re busy and you got things to do. We all do. But clear the air, if it needs to be cleared 🙃
Amay:Theek hai tu?
Amay:Kabhi call karley. Not sure what you’re trying to do, honestly. Whatever it is, I hope we’ll talk soon
Amay:Alright - i don’t feel good about this. Don’t think it’s so hard to take out a little time and talk. Only you know what you’re thinking. Bye
Amay:Azbee! Get a grip on yourself. Please don’t let this ruin a little bit of what we have. We are friends. Nothing else’s Let’s just maintain that. Don’t think too much. Just relax.
Amay:I’m not thinking anything else, I promise. I understood everything you told me the other day. I just wanna be friends. And nothing else. Please look at me like your friend you can reach out to anytime. All the other feelings are kept aside. I promise you and I won’t say anything or do anything that’ll make you feel pressured to do something on those lines. I’m sorry you feel I have negative energy. I feel sad about it but I’m going to keep very limited contact with you so I hope you understand my importance in your life (if you do), I really wish you feel better. It’s important for me. And for that if I have to even stop talking to you, I will.
Amay:I’m not rescinding anything. What I did, what I made, I put my heart and my love in it. You can destroy it and get rid of it if you want (don’t tell me) but please accept it. It resolves things for me. It resolves my feelings. Take it as a gesture of good faith. I’m over my feelings of deep attachment that I felt for you. I hope we can maintain a healthy friendship in the coming time.
Amay:Take care 🌺 warm hugs and lots of love dear. Have a good week 🙂
Amay:My one concern there is. If you are beginning to feel  this confused emotional platonic state because of me, these paranoia feelings because of ‘me’, then I must and I must stop talking to you. Absolutely no contact. I want you to feel better yar. I want you to feel positive, good and healthy. And if I’m being the reason you are going through all this again, I must leave. I have that much sense.
Amay:Please think clearly if we can be friends with minimum contact or does that not work as well. Maybe just observe things for some time and decide. If they don’t, I will be more than happy to not even say a word to you. But if it doesn’t, I hope we can be still be friends 🙂
Amay:Treat me like someone you can trust, Treat me like you someone you can pick up the phone and just call, Treat me like someone you can look upto for support, Treat me like someone who can hold your hand when you are low and tired of this life,Treat me like someone who can cheer you up, make you smile, and feel good,Treat me like your friend, not your lover, and respond with feelings that are pure, unbiased, unfettered by love but by care, compassion, empathy, support, and friendship. I don’t know what else to say. So I’ll stop saying and get back to my Dhyaan 🙂Have a good evening. P.s. don’t feel compelled to reply to any of this. Just clear your mind and understand it. I will seek acknowledgement in your silence.
